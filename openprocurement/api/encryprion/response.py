    """
    A Response object that can be used to serve a static file from disk
    simply.

    ``path`` is a file path on disk.

    ``request`` must be a Pyramid :term:`request` object.  Note
    that a request *must* be passed if the response is meant to attempt to
    use the ``wsgi.file_wrapper`` feature of the web server that you're using
    to serve your Pyramid application.

    ``cache_max_age`` is the number of seconds that should be used
    to HTTP cache this response.

    ``content_type`` is the content_type of the response.

    ``content_encoding`` is the content_encoding of the response.
    It's generally safe to leave this set to ``None`` if you're serving a
    binary file.  This argument will be ignored if you also leave
    ``content-type`` as ``None``.
